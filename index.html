      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Some specifications on the Web deal with defining sets of files or resources to be consumed together. A common design pattern is to provide a manifest or configuration file that defines which resources are available and how various resources should be used or to provide various kinds of metadata about a collection of resources.</p>
        
        <p>Some examples of specifications like this include Webapp [[APPMANIFEST]], Miniapp [[MINIAPP-MANIFEST]], and ePub [[EPUB-33]].</p>

        <p>Manifest file formats usually contain <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#def_syntactic_content">syntactic</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#def_user_supplied_value">user-supplied values</a> that are not localizable. But most manifest file formats also contain at least some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#def_localizable_content">localizable content</a> fields. A specification that defines a manifest file format that includes localizable content values needs to provide a means for users to localize the manifest into different languages. This document covers the pros and cons of common designs, along with some best practices related to building and managing manifests.</p>      
        
        <p>These (and many other) best practices, along with links to supporting materials, can also be found in the <cite>Internationalization Best Practices for Spec Developers</cite> [[INTERNATIONAL-SPECS]]. In addition to the best practices found here, additional best practices relating to language metadata on the Web can be found in [[STRING-META]]. Core terminology can also be found in the <cite>Internationalization Glossary</cite> [[I18N-GLOSSARY]].</p>

      <section id="use-cases">
		  <h2>Use Cases</h2>
		  <p>There are different ways that manifest files might be used on the Web and these affect the choice of manifest localization strategy.</p> 

          <p><dfn data-lt="packaged" class="lint-ignore export">Packaged Manifest.</dfn> Some manifests are packaged with other files to form an application or document. Since the manifest is generally consumed as part of the larger set of content and the content is downloaded as a single unit, manifests of this type can use more modular localization strategies, such as using multiple files with names or paths based on the locale.</p>
          
          <p><dfn data-lt="shorthand" class="lint-ignore export">Shorthand Description Manifest.</dfn> Some manifests are meant to be used as a shorthand description of an application, document, or other resource. Manifests of this type are often downloaded by the client, sometimes as a precursor to retrieving the actual resource or its component parts. Since retrieving multiple files has latency, size, and storage implications, this type of manifest usually seeks to use a single file or other less-modular approaches.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="language-preferences">
		  <h2>Managing Language Preferences</h2>
		  
          <p>Another consideration is the <a>language negotiation</a> strategy employed by the specification. If a manifest can be generated on demand (rather than being cached at a well-known URL), then the localization might be applied on a per-request basis. This points more toward a <a>shorthand</a> manifest style. In other cases, where some implementations might be able to negotiate while others cannot, it might be important for the specification to permit different strategies to be used.</p>
          
          <p>Bear in mind that modern operating environments support quite extensive sets of available locales and that application owners often wish to satisfy diverse audiences with a single localized application or document. While examples in specifications necessarily are constrained to perhaps three or four locales, actual applications with 50 or more specific locales are not uncommon.</p>
          
          <p>Manifests need to match a user's language preference to the available localized resources. The user's locale preference can include more than just a primary language subtag. It might include the script (in tags such as <code>zh-Hans</code>, meaning "Chinese as written in the Simplified Han script") or region (in tags such as <code>fr-CA</code>, meaning "French as used in Canada")&mdash;or both. Some systems support <a>Unicode Locale Identifiers</a>, an extension to [[BCP47]] that includes tailoring such as calendars, number shaping, collation, and more. For more information, see [[LTLI]].</p>
          
          <p>Matching localized resources to a user's locale preference usually involves "locale fallback", using a mechanism such as [[BCP47]]'s "lookup" matching scheme or [[CLDR]]'s "best match" scheme. These involve comparing the language tags on each resource seeking the <em>longest</em> tag that completely matches the user's preference. There is also, usually, a default locale to use for cases in which none of the localized resources match the user's preference.</p>

      <section id="">
		  <h2>Indicating Language and Direction</h2>
		  
		  <p><a>Natural language</a> values stored in a manifest, like any document format or data structure, require language and direction metadata in order to be used by <a>consumers</a> successfully. For detailed information about the requirements, see [[STRING-META]].</p>
		  
		  <p>There are four common serializations for string values in a manifest in the following sections. These are generally used together to form a complete localization solution.</p>
		  
		  <section id="non-linguistic">
			  <h4>Non-Linguistic Fields</h4>
		  <p>For <a>non-linguistic fields</a>, that is, strings that contain data that is not human language, no language or direction metadata should be associated with the value. If a language tag is required for the data, the value <code>zxx</code> (Non-Linguistic) should be used. The direction of the text should be set to "auto".</p>
		  
  
		  <aside class="example" title="Examples of non-linguistic string values">
			  <pre class="javascript">
"isbn": "978-123456789-X",
"part-number": "&#xa7;ABC-123-0094"
			  </pre>
		  </aside>
		  </section>
		  
		  <section id="single-linguistic-field">
			  <h4>Single-Language Localizable Text Field</h4>
		  <p>For <a>localizable text</a> fields that appear in a single language, use a data structure to represent the value. The recommended representation is an object with three fields. The field <code>value</code> contains the actual string. The field <code>lang</code> contains a valid [[BCP47]] language tag. The field <code>dir</code> contains the string's <a>base direction</a> (one of the values <code>ltr</code>, <code>rtl</code>, or <code>auto</code>).</p>
		  
		  <p>See <a data-cite="STRING-META#use-the-localizable-data-structure">The Localizable WebIDL Dictionary</a> in [[STRING-META]].</p>
		  
		  <aside class="example" title="Example of a localizable text field">
		  <pre class="json" id="localizable-text-field">
"field-name-goes-here": {
    "value": "This is the string value",
    "lang": "en-US",
    "dir": "ltr"
}
		  </pre>
		  </aside>
		  </section>
		  
		  <section id="language-defaults">
			  <h4>Document-Level Defaults</h4>
			  
			  <p>Single-language localizable text fields are at their best if there are only a few natural language strings in a given document. When a document such as a manifest contains many natural language strings, this becomes inefficient. To reduce the complexity of encoding these strings, one workaround is to establish a document-level default for language and base direction. These are separate values, as language does not imply direction. There should still be the ability to override either value on any given string value by using the single-language <a>localizable text</a> field representation found <a href="#single-linguistic-field">above</a>.</p>
			  
			  <p>For specifications that can make use of the [[JSON-LD]] <code>@context</code> mechanism, use the <code>@language</code> and <code>@direction</code> fields to supply the document level defaults.</p>
			  
			  <p>If your specification must define its own document level defaults, provide two optional fields. The document's default language field should be called <code>language</code> and can contain a valid [[BCP47]] language tag. The document's default <a>base direction</a> field should be called <code>direction</code> and support the values <code>ltr</code>, <code>rtl</code>, or <code>auto</code>.</p>

              <aside class="example" title="Example of document level defaults">
              <pre class="json">
"language": "en-US",
"direction": "ltr",
//...
"some-field-name": "This string is in U.S. English, thanks to the default",
// the following field overrides the language but not the direction:
"another-field-name": {
   "value": "Diese Zeichenfolge ist auf Deutsch",
   "lang": "de"
}
              </pre>
              </aside>
              
              <aside class="note">
				  <p><strong>Document level defaults are not a complete solution on their own.</strong> Specifications can define a document-level defaulting mechanism to assist users who often create monolingual documents. They are particularly useful when used in conjunction with the <a href="#locale-specific">locale-specific</a> or <a href="#hybrid">hybrid</a> approaches described later in this document. However, document-level defaults should only be used to augment the ability for users to provide string-specific metadata.</p>
              </aside>
		  </section>
		  
		  
		  <section id="language-maps">
		  <h4>Language Maps</h4>
		  
		  <p>The world is not monolingual. Having documents that contain only a single language would mean providing many iterations of the document, one for each language, in order to localize the manifest. This also might require language negotiation when requesting the manifest.</p>
		  
		  <p>One way to address this is to allow multilingual values for each <a>localizable text</a> field inside the manifest document.</p>
		  
		  <p>Language selection is not merely the exact matching of language tag string values to the user's preferred locale. The usual <a href="#localizable-text-field">object representation</a> of a <a>localizable text</a> field requires that the object be deserialized in order to discover the language tag associated with the value. This can be inefficient when there are many values in a given manifest file. In these cases, the best practice is to use a language map to organize <a>localizable text</a> values. Such a map exposes the language tag for the purposes of selection, but still uses an object representation on the value side of the map, since both language and direction might need to be overridden for a given string value.</p>
		  
		  <aside class="note">

		  <h2>Common Approaches</h2>
		  <p>There are several common approaches to creating localized manifests. Each offers certain advantages (and suffers from certain drawbacks):</p>
		  
		  <section id="unitary">
			  <h3>Unitary Manifest Files</h3>
			  <p>A unitary manifest approach provides for localization by defining localizable fields using an array of language values.</p>
			  
			  <aside class="example">
				  <p>Example of a unitary manifest:</p>
				  <pre class="json">{
   "appId": "myApplication",
   "releaseDate": "2021-06-07",
   "releaseUrl": "https://example.com/path/to/myApplication",

   // localizable values in a map
   "title": {
       "en": {"value": "My Application"},                   // English

       "de": {"value": "Mein Bewerbund"},                   // German
       "zh-Hans": {"value": "我的应用程序"}                   // Simplified Chinese
   },
   "author": {
       "en": {"value": "Example Corporation"},
       "fr": {"value": "Société Exemple"}
   }</pre>
			  </aside>

              <p>The advantages of a unitary manifest include:</p>
              
              <ol>
				  <li>The manifest is a single file, allowing for ease of downloading. 
				  <li>It is easier to ensure that the correct version of the resources in every language are being used.
				  <li>Language defaulting may be easier to manage.
              </ol>

              <p>There are also disadvantages to this approach:</p>
              
              <ol>
                  <li>If the manifest is rendered into many languages, the file's size may grow disproportionately.
                  <li>Localization processes are generally optimized to create files that are copies of the original, only with the language-bearing materials replaced. Creating, managing, and synchronizing localization in a highly multilingual file may be more complex than using separate files per language. Generating the manifest via scripts or tooling is one approach to managing this complexity.
              </ol>
              
              <p>Unitary manifests work best with smaller source files with a limited number of localizable content fields and/or a limited number of languages. Most unitary manifests define some type of “language indexing” scheme (such as found in [[JSON-LD]]) to perform the actual selection.</p>
		  </section>
		  
		  <section id="locale-specific">
			  <h3>Language or Locale-specific Manifest Files</h3>
			  
			  <p>Locale-specific manifests create a separate file for each supported language or locale. Usually the specification will <a href="#path-vs-file">choose either a <code>path</code> or <code>filename</code> based organizational scheme</a> for allocating and finding the manifest files.</p>

              <ol>

		  <section id="hybrid">
			  <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
			  <p>A common compromise is to have a central manifest file that contains most or all of the non-localizable content, coupled with separate files that contains the localizable content. In some cases, the central manifest file contains defaults for the localizable content. The central manifest might also contain a directory or list of available locales (or the URL of language-specific manifests) so that clients only need to try to retrieve localized files that are actually available.</p>

      <section id="path-vs-file">
		  <h2>Path versus File Name Localization</h2>
		  <p>Some manifests opt to store localized variants of the manifest using modification of the path. Others prefer to modify the file name.</p>
		  
		  <aside class="example">
			  <pre>Path-based: /manifests/en-US/myApplication.json
File-based: /manifests/myApplication-en-US.json
			  </pre>
		  </aside>
		  
		  <p>Path-based storage has the advantage that multiple files can be localized together. For example, the localized manifest can include a localized icon, logo, stylesheet, README, and terms-of-service file together with the manifest. New languages can be added by adding a new directory.</p>
		  
          <p>Path-based systems have the disadvantage that the filenames are generally “all the same” and the contents of a given file is not obvious from the filename—only by its location in the application hierarchy.</p>
          
          <p>Filename-based storage has the advantage that the contents of the file is obvious from the filename and managing files can sometimes be easier in this regard.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="other">
		  <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
		  <p>Note that manifest localization does not remove the need for the string content in a manifest to provide language and direction metadata for each separate data value. The manifest file can define a file-wide default for language and direction, but specific files should be able to override either value. See [[STRING-META]] for more information.</p>
		  
		  <p>Some manifests allow for "sparse population" of values in the localized file. For example, the <code>en-US</code> (English, United States) file might only contain one or two US-specific values, relying on the <code>en</code> (English) file for most of its content. Specifications need to be explicit about whether sparse population is allowed and how it works to avoid misconfiguration errors or missing translations.</p>
